# Loops

## Planned
All loops support `break` and `continue` statements. They can only exist inside a loop or a syntax error is raised.

## While Loops
```
while condition:
  pass
```

## For Loops
For loops are compiled into while loops.
```
for i = 0; i < 10; ++i:
  pass  # 0 to 9
```

There is a shorthand notation for the basic loop.
```
for i in 0..10:
  pass  # 0 to 9
```
